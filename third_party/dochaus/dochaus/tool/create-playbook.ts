// per-deployment library (WORKSPACE_ROOT/.playbooks), owned by the ingest
// service. The body is the playbook skill markdown — one `##` section per clause
// type with Preferred/Fallbacks/Unacceptable/Rationale and ```approved fences
// carrying the firm-approved clause text copied byte-exact from the source
// document. The name must start "playbook-" so it qualifies as a playbook skill
// (the discovery scan and the matter playbook binding both require that prefix).
