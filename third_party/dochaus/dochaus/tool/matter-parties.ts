// doc.haus party lookup tool. Reads the `parties` table that
// `services/ingest` populates deterministically (structure.ts): each row is a
// party name regex-extracted verbatim from a document's preamble, with offsets
// into that document's extracted text. Nothing here is generated — the tool
// only echoes stored rows, so it cannot fabricate a party. A parse miss is an
// absent row, and the tool says so and points at search-document instead of
// guessing. This tool is read-only; all writes happen in the ingest service.
