// doc.haus list-playbooks tool. Returns the firm's playbook library — the
// repo-shipped playbook skills (read-only) plus the imported ones in
// WORKSPACE_ROOT/.playbooks — with full bodies, version/date metadata, and the
// matters each playbook is currently bound to. Playbooks are skills named
// playbook-*, but they have their own library and lifecycle; list-skills never
// shows them.
