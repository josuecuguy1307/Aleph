// Two seeds live here, with different lifetimes:
//
//   seedPlaybooks() — the repo-shipped starter playbook library, copied into the
//   firm's WORKSPACE_ROOT/.playbooks on every ingest server boot (server.ts calls
//   it on startup). Not demo content: every install gets the starter set.
//
//   seedDemo() — the demo matter: a wholly fictional letter of engagement,
//   ingested through the real pipeline so a first-time user lands on a matter
//   that already answers cited questions and runs a legal review — no upload, no
//   data of their own required. Demo-gated: it only runs via this script
//   (`start.sh --demo` / `cd services/ingest && bun run seed`).
//
// seedDemo also writes the generated .docx to repo `demo/` so the same file can
// be dropped into a new matter through the web UI. Everything in it is invented;
// Aldgate & Crane LLP and Aldgate Mills Limited do not exist.

// dochaus/playbooks/ holds the repo-shipped starter playbooks — kept out of
// dochaus/skill/ so the engine and listPlaybooks() never auto-discover them from
// the repo; the firm's selectable library is WORKSPACE_ROOT/.playbooks, the same
// directory POST /playbooks imports into. Each starter is copied in at most once,
// tracked by name in the .seeded marker file: a starter the firm deleted stays
// deleted (delete-playbook is first-class), edits and same-name imports are never
// clobbered, and newly shipped starters still reach existing installs.

  [
    "7. Your responsibilities",
    "You agree to give us clear and timely instructions, to provide the documents and information we reasonably request, to put us in funds as agreed, and to tell us promptly of any change to the transaction or your instructions. Delay in any of these may affect our estimate and the timetable.",

    "9. Limitation of liability",
    "Our total aggregate liability to you arising out of or in connection with this engagement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty or otherwise, is limited to £3 million, which corresponds to our professional indemnity insurance cover. We are not liable for any indirect or consequential loss, or for loss of profit, revenue, or anticipated savings. Nothing in this clause limits any liability that cannot lawfully be limited, including liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence or for fraud.",
  ],
  [
    "10. Conflicts of interest",
    "We have checked for conflicts of interest and are not aware of any that prevent us acting for you. If a conflict arises during the engagement, we will tell you and explain the options, which may include our ceasing to act.",
  ],
  [
    "11. Data protection",
    "We process your personal data as a controller in order to act for you, in accordance with the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. We retain your file for seven years after the matter closes, after which we may destroy it without further reference to you. Our privacy notice gives further detail.",
  ],
  [
    "12. Termination",
    "You may end this engagement at any time by written notice. We may cease to act only for good reason, such as a conflict of interest, non-payment of our bills, or your failure to give instructions, and on giving you reasonable written notice. On termination you remain liable for our fees and disbursements incurred up to that point.",
  ],
  [
    "13. Complaints",
    "We aim to provide a high standard of service. If you are unhappy with our service or a bill, please raise it first with Daniel Crane. If we cannot resolve it, you may be entitled to complain to the Legal Ombudsman, normally within six months of our final response.
